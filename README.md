# Reliable and Accurate LLM Application with Voting Systems

This repository contains the code for a simple application that implements a voting system using multiple LLM APIs. It is a companion to the blog post "Building a Reliable and Accurate LLM Application with Voting Systems." This code will help you enhance the reliability and accuracy of your LLM-powered applications by combining the outputs of Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and OpenAI GPT-4o.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI GPT-4o
  - Google Gemini 1.5 Pro
  - Claude Sonnet 3.5

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-system-llm.git
   cd voting-system-llm
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `app.py` and replace placeholder strings with your actual API keys for OpenAI, Google, and Claude.

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The main code in `app.py` includes functions to get responses from each LLM API and a voting system to determine the final response based on majority or weighted voting. You can modify the voting mechanism as needed.

## Features

- **Majority Voting**: Aggregates responses from multiple LLMs and selects the most frequent one.
- **Weighted Voting**: Assigns weights to each LLM based on their performance and selects the response with the highest weighted score.
- **Flexible and Extensible**: Easily add or remove LLMs by updating the API calls and weights.

## Enhancements

Consider implementing the following enhancements for better performance:

- **Weighted Voting**: Adjust weights based on model performance over time.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Keep track of each model's accuracy and adjust the voting system accordingly.

## Best Practices

- **Model Diversity**: Use different types of LLMs to benefit from diverse perspectives.
- **Data Management**: Properly handle training and validation data to avoid data leakage and ensure fair evaluation.
- **Regular Evaluation**: Continuously evaluate the performance of your voting system and individual models to maintain high accuracy and reliability.
